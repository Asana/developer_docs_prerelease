Hello, and welcome to Asana's Developer Documentation page!
======

If you would like to contribute, we'd love to receive a PR from you! First, here's a few things to know:

Asana's docs are published on Github Pages. You can go directly to the documents by going to https://asana.github.io/<reponame>.

The master branch is protected and can only be committed to by an Asana team member. If you'd like to create a change, please do it in a topic branch and create a PR for us in github.

Certain parts of our documentation are generated from our OpenAPI spec, and so any changes to the docs need to be made upstream there.
