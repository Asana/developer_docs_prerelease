We&rsquo;re announcing a new feature for the API today: <a href="https://blog.asana.com/2013/04/introducing-asana-connect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Asana Connect</a>!

Asana Connect uses OAuth 2.0 to authenticate users, so you no longer have to ask them to supply an API key. There&rsquo;s plenty of documentation, some <a href="https://github.com/Asana/oauth-examples">example code</a>, and even a <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/omniauth-asana">ruby gem for omniauth</a>.

This was an extremely popular request, so we&rsquo;re looking forward to seeing lot of &ldquo;Sign in with Asana&rdquo; buttons. If you hit any problems, be sure to let us know by reporting issues (or feedback) to <a href="mailto:api-support@asana.com">api-support@asana.com</a>!
