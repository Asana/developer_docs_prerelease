We&rsquo;re pleased to announce that the first public version of the Asana API is live!

Existing developers should take note of an important change. The base URL for all API requests has changed to:

    https://app.asana.com/api/1.0

Notice we have changed the version number _and_ removed the leading dash (-) from the path. We will keep the old 0.1 access point around for a while and give you time to switch over, but will end-of-life it soon. Please update your clients!

Thanks for being a part of our early access program. Happy developing!
