#### More API Key Deprecation Details

See our [API Key Deprecation article](/developers/feed/api-key-deprecation) for more background about our upcoming removal of the API Key as a means of authentication.

**On January 20, 2016, new Asana users will no longer be able to generate API keys.** Here are a few things to keep in mind:

 - This means if you have deployed an application that requires an API key, you will be unable to accept new users.
 - Users with existing API keys will be unaffected by this change. This means all apps will continue to work for all their existing users.

In 4-6 months, Asana will no longer accept any API keys to authenticate.

 - If you have an application that still uses API keys, it will stop working.
