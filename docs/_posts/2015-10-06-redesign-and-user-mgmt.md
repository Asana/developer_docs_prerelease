#### New Asana assets

We'd appreciate your help in updating any existing Asana assets on your properties to our new style. Our new logo,
updated screenshots, and brand guidelines can be directly downloaded from our
[press page](/press#assets).

If you currently include a company description about Asana on any of your properties we'd appreciate you updating it
to the following:

Asana is the easiest way for teams to track their work. From tasks and projects to conversations and dashboards,
Asana enables teams to move work from start to finish--and get results.  

#### User Management

We recently released a few API endpoints that allow for easy user management through the API. Invite new members to an
organization or add them to a team; administrators can even remove a user from an organization with a simple API call!

Head on over to our API reference documentation on [Teams](/developers/api-reference/teams#users)
and [Workspaces](/developers/api-reference/workspaces#user-mgmt) to see the endpoints we have added.
Also make sure to check out the [sample application](https://github.com/Asana/asana-invite) that demonstrates how
these endpoints all work together!
