We&rsquo;ve fixed a few bugs in the last week, including:

- The &ldquo;method&rdquo; option was ineffective when using it in the POST body.
- 500 error when setting a task assignee to `null`.

Just a reminder to our developers that if you receive a 500 response, you&rsquo;ve probably hit a bug in the API. Please don&rsquo;t be shy about reporting it to <a href="mailto:api-support@asana.com">api-support@asana.com</a>!
